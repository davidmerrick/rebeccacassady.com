Recently David and I headed out to the western island of Corfu in Greece, just southwest of Albania.  I've only been to Greece one previous time, and I loved it so much I knew I had to return.  This was David's first time and I don't think it will be his last.

Due to a nasty storm mid-week we ended up hopping a plane to Athens and spent the remainder of our trip in the big city exploring ruins and the city delights.  Although Athens had never been on my list of places to see, I'm sure glad I did as the history is exhilirating as one of the oldest cities in Western civilization.
