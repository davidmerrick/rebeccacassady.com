I joined Thomas, Coon, Newton & Frost in 2014 after graduating from Portland State with a BA in History.

I work with the Personal Injury team and enjoy working with my attorneys to represent injured Oregonians in their personal injury claims.

I also assist with medical negligence, wrongful death, and legal malpractice cases.
